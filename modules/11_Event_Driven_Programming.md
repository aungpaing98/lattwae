## Event
- "something which happens"
- To handle events (button clicking, typing, etc.), we register event listeners. An event listener is a function which listens for an event to occur and executes in response.

## Procedural Programming
- functions are called in a specific order


The difference between two types of programming is the timing when the function will be called.
