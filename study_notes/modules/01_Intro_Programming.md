## Programming

- Programming (also known as coding) is the process of writing instructions to a device, such as a computer or mobile device.

- We write these instructions by using a programming language, which is then interpreted by the device. These sets of instructions may be referred to by various names. A few popular names are program, computer program, application (app), and executable.
